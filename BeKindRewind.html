            <h3> About Us </h3>
            <p> 
                This production company is an outlet for the creative endeavors of <strong>Chris Perez</strong> 
                Perhaps one day it can represent more people, maybe it's pointless.
                <em> Nonetheless</em>, this is my attempt to have my shit together.
                <br><br>
                I was born during the actualization of digital media, so I was able to develope a deep apreciation for physical media.
                I witnessed the abandonment of video casset tapes and later CD's. Although it was easy to move beyond these artifacts
                and their limitations, they have grown to represent a simpler time albeit more flawed era.
                <br><br>
                I observed as imperfections in videos and pictures became <i>en vogue</i>, with apps like Instagram and VSCO dominating
                the photo editing space during my teenage years. I participated in Instagram myself, wrongly believing that the application
                was <em>only</em> a photo editor. It wasn't until after the <strong>SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></a> became popular in my highscool 
                that I realized everyone could see my photos, even the ones that were rough drafts of what I actually posted on Facebook,
                the dominant social media at the time. See how I already sound like a Boomer?
